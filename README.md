# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country and shape in the UFO webpage.

This project consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report. We will submit the following deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

### Results

Snippet of Previous Webpage

In the previous webpage as shown above we can see that we only had one filter date, where we can filter the table as per the date. Now we have added for filter criteria where the user can filter with more fields. We have added city, state, country and shape in the UFO webpage. 

Snippet of New Webpage with new filters

In the previous webpage the user add to click the filter button to apply the filter, however in the new version the user would just enter the criteria in the filter field, then the webpage will automatically filter the table as per the user criteria. 

The following webpage shows the table as per the user criteria:

So the user only needs to enter their criteria in the filter field to get the data they desire. 

### Summary

The new webpage has more filter fields so that it is easy for the user to get specific data. To enchance the webpage further we need to fix the drawbacks. One of the drawback is that the webpage is not able to save the filter data and always the user would need to take a screenshot of the data. So one of the enchancement to the webpage could be to add a save button to save the table. Other things that can make the webpage look attractive is to align the table and the information as right now it is not aligned and it does not look great. We could also add more CSS styles to make it attractive.
